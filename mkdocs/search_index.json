In \ndiffusion_biology_behaviors.h\n you can\ncheck the source code of this module. Basically it makes cells move according to the gradient,\ncaused by a concentration difference of the substance. One of the cells\n(the cell at position \n{50, 50, 50}\n) will be the one secreting the substance;\nit therefore gets assigned the \nSubstanceSecretion\n behavior.\n\n\nFurthermore, we define the initial positions of the cells. In this example it is\ndone explicitly, but one could also generate a grid of cells, or a random distribution\nof cells.\n\n\nConfigure the simulation\n\n\nCreate a \nbdm.toml\n file in the \ndiffusion\n directory, and copy the following lines\ninto it:\n\n\n[visualization]\n\n\nexport\n \n=\n \ntrue\n\n\nexport_interval\n \n=\n \n10\n\n\n    \n[[visualize_sim_object]]\n\n    \nname\n \n=\n \n\"Cell\"\n\n\n    additional_data_members = [ \"diameter_\" ]\n\n\n    \n[[visualize_diffusion]]\n\n    \nname\n \n=\n \n\"Kalium\"\n\n\n    gradient = true\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will enable exporting visualization files, so that we can visualize the\nsimulation after it has finished. Furthermore, we enable the output of the diameter\nof our simulation objects (by default named \"Cell\"), and the gradient data of the\nextracellular diffusion\n\n\nBuild and run the simulation\n\n\n\n\nNote (for Mac OS users)\n\n\nIn order for the CLI to be available in your shell environment\nit is necessary to run the following command:\n\n\nsource biodynamo.env\n\n\n\n\nRun the following commands to build and run the simulation.\n\n\nbiodynamo run\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualize the simulation\n\n\nOpen ParaView and navigate to the \ndiffusion\n directory. Open the \ncells_data_*\n\nand \nKalium_*\n files as Group (see the \nVisualization\n exercise as a reference).\n\n\nClick on the \ncells_data_\n entry in the Pipeline Browser. From \"Filters\", select\n\"Search\" (or do \nCtrl + Space\n).
